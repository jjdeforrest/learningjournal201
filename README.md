Andragogy vs. Pedagogy

Both are completley neccassary in balance to progress. You have to have the desire to get ahead but also short cuts can be offered by those with more experience and wisdom which could save you valuable time. Which will allow you to move on and learn more things. If you do not have enough drive even if someone is teaching you it will be meaningless. Also no one person are group of people have all the knowledge of time and future. So it is critical to self direct yourself to push the limits of knowledge to constantly find out more.
